YOLO v8 Model for Object Detection
YOLO v8 is a state-of-the-art object detection model that can be used for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. It is known for its speed and accuracy, making it a popular choice for computer vision tasks. Here is a guide on how to use YOLO v8 for object detection.

Why Should I Use YOLOv8?

Here are a few main reasons why you should consider using YOLOv8 for your next computer vision project:

YOLOv8 has a high rate of accuracy measured by COCO and Roboflow 100.
YOLOv8 comes with a lot of developer-convenience features, from an easy-to-use CLI to a well-structured Python package.
There is a large community around YOLO and a growing community around the YOLOv8 model, meaning there are many people in computer vision circles who may be able to assist you when you need guidance.
YOLOv8 achieves strong accuracy on COCO. For example, the YOLOv8m model -- the medium model -- achieves a 50.2% mAP when measured on COCO. When evaluated against Roboflow 100, a dataset that specifically evaluates model performance on various task-specific domains, YOLOv8 scored substantially better than YOLOv5. More information on this is provided in our performance analysis later in the article.












DETR (DEtection TRansformer) is an end-to-end object detection model introduced by Facebook Research in 2020


It is a transformer-based model that uses a set-based global loss and an encoder-decoder architecture to predict object classes and bounding boxes directly from an image. Here are some key features of DETR:
Transformer-based: DETR replaces the traditional object detection pipeline with a transformer-based approach, which allows it to reason about the relations of objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel

End-to-end: DETR is trained end-to-end on the COCO 2017 object detection dataset, which consists of 118k annotated images
This means that the entire object detection pipeline is learned from scratch, without the need for hand-crafted features or intermediate representations.
Object queries: DETR uses a fixed set of learned object queries to detect objects in an image. Each object query looks for a particular object in the image, and the number of object queries is set to 100 for COCO

Fast: DETR is known for its fast inference speed, which allows it to process images in real-time

Simple: DETR has a simple architecture that does not require the manual specification of anchor boxes or other hyperparameters

Overall, DETR is a promising approach to object detection that offers several advantages over traditional object detection models. It is transformer-based, end-to-end, fast, and simple, making it a popular choice for computer vision tasks.
